                    <p>In the event that We suspect that a Player is opening multiple accounts by using the same or similar names, address, telephones, email addresses, same or similar dynamic IP addresses, computer or other devices, with the intent of defrauding or cheating, We reserve the right to close the Account or Accounts at any time and to cancel all the transactions, bets, waive winnings and deduct bonuses from all relevant Accounts.</p>

                    <p>In the event of misuse and/or the abuse of the Internet Site and/or the Software, We reserve the right to close or block the Accounts of the Player in question until the matter between Atlantic Slot and the Player is resolved.</p>

                    <h3>Dormant and Inactive Accounts</h3>
                    <p>If the Player does not access his/her Account by "logging in" using his/her Username and Password for any period of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days, his/her Account shall be deemed to be "Dormant".</p>
                    <p>If the Player does not access his/her Account by "logging in" using his/her Username and Password for any period of twelve (12) consecutive calendar months, his/her Account shall be deemed to be "Inactive."</p>
                    <p>If Your account remains inactive (i.e. when no login is performed via the Website) for a period of more than 12 months, we are entitled to charge a monthly account maintenance fee of €5, starting on the 13th month of inactivity.</p>
                    <p>Following 12 months of uninterrupted inactivity, we will send a reminder email to You via the email address saved in Your Account details. Upon receipt of this reminder mail, You will have 30 days to log in to Your Account and also to withdraw funds. If no login is registered within this 30-day period, €5 of Deposit Funds, or in the absence of Deposit Funds, Bonus Funds, will be deducted from the balance. If the balance is less than €5 then the whole amount will be deducted. From the 12th month of inactivity onwards, a monthly charge of €5 will be incurred and deducted from the real money credit or bonus money credit of the player account accordingly. Provided that if the account is inactive due to a definite period of self-exclusion, inactivity fees shall not be charged during that period and resume 30 days following the expiration of the definite self-exclusion period.</p>
                    <p>No administrative charge shall be charged when a Player seeks to re-activate his Account.
                    <p>In the case of inactive, dormant, closed, blocked and excluded Accounts, funds may be recovered by sending an email to Atlantic Slot’s Customer Support on <a href="mailto:support@atlantic.com">support@atlantic.com</a>.</p>
